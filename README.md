# Covid-19-Analysis-And-Visualization
This repo includes the exploratory data analysis and interesting visualizations to better understand the data, to understand what the data is trying to saying &amp; finding its hidden insights and patterns. This repository includes 4 notebooks in which I have shown the analysis on the data of India & all over the World, give the idea about the capacity of patients a state can sustain and the bar chart race of India states.

1. **"Covid-19 EDA on India data"** - This notebook provides you the analysis of Indian States - how the positive cases have increased till the date, what are the active cases of each state per day, what are the total active cases in India on a day-to-day basis. What is the percentage of population that has been infected till the date.

2. **"Covid-19 Flattening the curve"** - This notebook gives you the idea about flattening the curve, by how much amount we need to lower the cases so to easily handle the increasing cases. It also gives you the capacity of patients (number of available hospital beds in each state & how many more we needed (if any)). It is available on the day-to-day basis as well as on the basis so to get an overview of this.

3. **"Covid-19 Bar Chart Race"** - It shows you the bar chart race of Indian states which shows us that how the confirmed or positive corona cases has been increasing day by day in each & every state.

4. **"Covid-19 Data"** - This notebook is about the analysis of each & every country where the cases has been confirmed. It shows us which country has what percentage of cases out of the total cases all over the world. It gives us the answers of various questions like - **What are the top 10 countries where there is a high risk of infection or in other words where there is a high spread rate so to look after them more carefully ?** ; **What are the top 10 countries where there is a high death rate so to look after those countries & try to find out the reason behind it ?** ; **What are those countries where the recovery rate is high as there maybe less chance of infection or the people living there have strong immunity so to know the kind of medication they are getting which may help other countries in reducing the cases ?** etc.

The dataset for the above analysis is taken from the below link which is provided by **Mr. Sudalai Rajkumar (SRK)** on the Kaggle platform. Link:-
